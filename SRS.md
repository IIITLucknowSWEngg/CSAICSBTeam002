## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Uber clone application is an independent system designed to operate on mobile devices. It interfaces with external systems such as payment gateways, GPS services, and third-party APIs for map integration. The system will be built using a modular architecture to facilitate scalability and maintainability.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- User registration and authentication.
- Ride booking and management.
- Real-time driver tracking.
- Payment processing and history tracking.
- Rating and review system.
- In-app communication between users and drivers.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Riders**: Individuals using the app to book rides.
- **Drivers**: Individuals using the app to offer ride services.
- **Admins**: Individuals managing the platform, overseeing user and driver activities.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The application will operate on Android and iOS mobile platforms. It will require internet connectivity for real-time functionalities like ride booking, payment processing, and GPS tracking. The backend will be hosted on cloud servers with high availability and reliability.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
